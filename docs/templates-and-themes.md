# Templates and themes

mashay separates *layout* from *styling*:

- **Templates** are `templates/<name>/template.html` (an HTML skeleton whose
  chrome and layout are authored with Tailwind utility classes referencing
  `var(--color-*)` tokens) plus a colocated `templates/<name>/template.css` — the
  non-colour design tokens (fonts, spacing, radii, transitions, z-index), the
  component/structural CSS, and the typography plugin's `--tw-prose-*` mappings.
- **Themes** are `themes/<name>/theme.css` files containing **colour tokens
  only** — a standardized `--color-*` set that every template is written
  against. Swapping the theme swaps the palette; because the token names are
  shared, any theme pairs with any template.

Select them with `--template <name>` (default `academic`) and `--theme <name>`
(defaults to the template's name). One template and one theme ship today, both
named `academic`; they pair by default, but you can mix and match:

```bash
mashay process ./my-doc.md --template academic --theme academic
```

Unknown template or theme names error with the list of available names. The
architecture is built so more templates and themes can be added later.

At build time, Tailwind v4 and `@tailwindcss/typography` compile only the CSS
the page actually uses, and it's inlined into a single `<style>` block — so the
output is one self-contained `.html` file. The only exception: a document
containing a Mermaid diagram still loads Mermaid's renderer from a CDN at view
time.

> _Coming later: a `--style` preview command for browsing template/theme
> combinations._
